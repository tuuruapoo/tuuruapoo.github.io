but of what?</p>

<p>Is it fear that the future will be bleak,<br />
because it will.<br />
Is it fear of the past,<br />
because the trauma resurfaces.<br />
Is it fear of the present -<br />
but how is fear of the present possible?<br />
I realise it cannot be fear of the present.</p>

<p>Remember,<br />
as a child,<br />
holding tight to the bar across your legs,<br />
while you rode the rollercoaster?<br />
The excitement of what is ahead -<br />
and the trepidation. <br />
It is like that,<br />
but without the excitement.</p>

<p>Can it be just fear of what the future will bring -<br />
or is it,<br />
perhaps,<br />
the anxiety of not wanting to deal with people.<br />
People are so tedious,<br />
so capricious,<br />
so self-centred.</p>

<p>If you woke up tomorrow and you were the last person on Earth,<br />
would you still have this anxiety?</p>

<p>I think not.</p>]]></content><author><name>Gerald Tūruapō Jordan, MBA, MEd, MCouns</name></author><category term="poetry" /><category term="anxiety" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Waking up terrified - but of what?]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Beginnings</title><link href="https://kaitoa.nz/beginnings/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Beginnings" /><published>2024-11-25T10:27:00+13:00</published><updated>2024-11-25T10:27:00+13:00</updated><id>https://kaitoa.nz/beginnings</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://kaitoa.nz/beginnings/"><![CDATA[<p>Where do you begin to challenge injustice that circles the globe -<br />
where do you begin to advocate for peace,<br />
when the tables of almost everyone,<br />
when the bowels of almost everyone,<br />
are full of suffering,<br />
are full of violence,<br />
are full of indifference?</p>

<p>It feels like a daunting task,<br />
but it is one that must be begun,<br />
for if we never begin,<br />
we will never arrive at a better world.</p>

<p>A world of empathy, kindness and compassion.<br />
A world where all are recognised for their intrinsic value.</p>

Don't get me wrong, I have a lot to learn! The issues with the courses I have found include things like a strange 20th Century expectation that I would want to sit in the same room with others, when I was actually just WRITING. If you can't write from a distance, you can do almost nothing from a distance. Other issues? Finding courses with writers teaching who seemed to know what they were doing, finding courses that would emphasise what I wanted to emphasise, etc.</p>

<p>So, I have created this site to focus in writing and writers in Aotearoa New Zealand!</p>

<p>I will discuss the name choice and other things, soon!</p>

<p>Ka pai!</p>
